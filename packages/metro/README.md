# Metro

üöá The JavaScript bundler for React Native.

- **üöÖ Fast**: We aim for sub-second reload cycles, fast startup and quick bundling speeds.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Scalable**: Works with thousands of modules in a single application.
- **‚öõÔ∏è Integrated**: Supports every React Native project out of the box.

This project was previously part of the [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository. In this smaller repository it is easier for the team working on Metro to respond to both issues and pull requests. See [react-native#13976](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13976) for the initial announcement.

## Reverse Proxy and `baseUrl` Support

This is exploritory functionalityby @codepilots. It may or may not work, use at your own risk!

### Overview
This fork adds robust support for running Metro behind a reverse proxy by introducing a configurable `baseUrl` option. All URLs and file paths served by the Metro server‚Äîincluding bundles, source maps, HMR, delta, assets, symbolicate, and all other endpoints‚Äîare now correctly prefixed with the configured `baseUrl`. This ensures Metro can be hosted at a non-root path and all outgoing URLs and endpoint routing will work as expected.

### Approach
- **Configurable `baseUrl`**: The server reads a `baseUrl` from the config and uses it to prefix all served URLs and endpoint matches.
- **Endpoint Routing**: All endpoint handlers in `Server.js` use utilities to strip or add the `baseUrl` for correct internal routing and external URL generation.
- **Outgoing URLs**: All outgoing URLs in responses (such as asset metadata, bundle URLs, source maps, and module source URLs in source maps and error stacks) are generated with the `baseUrl` prefix.
- **Asset Metadata**: The `.assets` endpoint and asset metadata now use the baseUrl-prefixed `/assets` as their `publicPath`.
- **Source Maps**: Module source URLs in source maps are baseUrl-prefixed when using server-relative paths.
- **HMR and Async Split Bundles**: All dynamic bundle URLs are constructed with the `baseUrl`.

### Key Changes
- Added `_prefixWithBaseUrl` and `_stripBaseUrl` utilities in `Server.js` for consistent path handling.
- Updated all endpoint routing and outgoing URL generation to use these utilities.
- Ensured asset metadata and module source URLs are always baseUrl-aware.
- Updated HMR and async split bundle URL construction to use `baseUrl`.
- All changes are Flow-typed and maintain compatibility with the existing Metro codebase.

### Usage
To use Metro behind a reverse proxy, set the `baseUrl` option in your Metro config:

```js
// metro.config.js
module.exports = {
  baseUrl: '/my/proxy/path',
  // ...other config
};
```

All served URLs and endpoint routing will now respect this baseUrl.
